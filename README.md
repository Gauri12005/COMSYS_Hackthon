# 🧠 FACECOM Challenge: Face Recognition & Gender Classification in Challenging Environments

## 📌 Problem Statement

Face recognition algorithms often struggle with images captured in degraded environments such as blur, fog, rain, or low-light. This project addresses these challenges using the **FACECOM** dataset, aiming to build two robust models:

- **Task A:** Gender Classification (Binary)
- **Task B:** Face Recognition (Multi-class)

---

## 📂 Dataset: FACECOM

FACECOM is a purpose-built dataset with 5,000+ images captured or synthesized under conditions like:

- Motion Blur
- Overexposure / Sunny
- Fog
- Rain
- Low Light
- Glare / Uneven Lighting

### 🏷 Annotations

- **Gender:** Male / Female
- **Identity (ID):** Person ID for face recognition

### 📊 Splits

- Train: 70%
- Validation: 15%
- Test: 15% (hidden for final evaluation)

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Task A – Gender Classification**
  - Predict gender (Binary Classification)
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

- **Task B – Face Recognition**
  - Predict identity (Multi-class Classification)
  - Metrics: Top-1 Accuracy, Macro F1-score

**💡 Final Score = 30% (Task A) + 70% (Task B)**
